# Robot-Path-Maping

This is a program which uses convex hull algorithm to detect the boundaries of the obstacles, which are placed in between
two position starting and ending point of the racing arena(2D) of the object.

Using the boundary which we get by convex hull and then the use of dijsktras algorithm we arrive at the shortest path for the movement of the robot from the starting point and the ending point.(ongoing)
